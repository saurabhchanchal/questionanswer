    <h3>What is CSS ?</h3>
    <p>Cascading style sheet (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage. with CSS, you can control the color,font, the size of text, the spacing between
        elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background color are to be used, different display for different different
        divices and screen sizes, and much more!.
    </p>


    <h3>what is box model?</h3>
    <p>* In CSS,the term "box model" is used when taking about design and layout.</p>
    <p>* The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: Margin, Borders,Padding, and actual content.</p> 

    <h3>what is the difference b/w padding and margin ?</h3>
    <p>* padding is the space between element and related content inside it. margin is space around element.</p>
    <p>* It is not possibe to set auto padding but for margin it is possible to set auto margin.</p>
    <p>* It is not possible to use negative when defining padding, but you can with margins. </p>
    <p>* padding can be impacted by the styling of other elements, margin wou't be impacted by the styling of other elements.</p>

    <h3>what is the Z index?</h3>
    <p>* Z index is the property which specify the stack order of element</p>
    <p>* An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with lower stack order.</p>

    <h3>How can we hide the div?</h3>
    <p>* if we use "display:none" in css and it will not take any space</p>
    <p>* if we use "visibility: hidden" it hide the element but still effect the layout.</p>

    <h3>what is the difference between class and id?</h3>
    <p>* Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page.</p>

    <h3>What is the difference between inline, inline-block, and block?</h3>
    <p>* Compared to display:inline, the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a height and width on the element.</p>
    <p> also top and bottom margins/padding are respected in inline-block but with inline they are not</p>
    <p>* Compared tp display:block, the major difference is  that display:inline-block does not add a line-break after the element,</p>
    <p>   so the element can sit next to other elements.</p>

    <h3>what are the css selectors?</h3>
    <p>* CSS selectors are used to "Select" the HTML elements you want to style.</p>
    <p>* We can divide CSS selectors into five categories</p>
         <h4>1. Simple selectors (select elements based on name,id ,class)</h4>
         <h4>2. Combinator selectors (select elements based on specific relationship between them)</h4>
         <h4>3. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)</h4>
         <h4>4. Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style part of elements)</h4> 
         <h4>5. Attributes selectors (select elements based on on an attributes)</h4> 

   <h3>Combinator selectors?(select elements based on specific relationship between them)</h3>   
   <p>* There are four different combinator in CSS.</p> 
          <h4>1. descendant selector(space)</h4>  
          <h4>2. child selector(>)</h4>
          <h4>3. Adjecent sibling selector(+)</h4>
          <h4>4. general sibling selectors(~)</h4>


    <h3>What are Pseudo-classes?</h3> 
    <p>* Pseudo-class is used to define special state of an element.</p> 
    <p>for example, It can be used to.</p>   
       <p><b>. style an element when a user mouses hover it.</b></p>
       <p><b>. style visited and unvisited links differently.</b></p>
       <p><b>. style an element when it focus.</b></p>

   <h3>What are Pseudo-Elements?</h3> 
   <p>* Pseudo-elements is used to style specific parts of elements.</p> 
   <p>for example , It can be used to.</p>  
       <p><b>. Style the first letter, or line, of an element.</b></p>
       <p><b>. Insert content before, or after , the content of an element.</b></p>

   <h3>CSS [attribute="value"]  Selector ?</h3>   
   <p>* The [attribute] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.</p> 

   <h3>CSS margin ?</h3>
   <p>* The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined border.</p>
   <p>When one value is specified, it applies the same margin to all four sides. <br>
    When two values are specified, the first margin applies to the top and bottom, the second to the left and right. <br>
    When three values are specified, the first margin applies to the top, the second to the right and left, the third to the bottom. <br>
    When four values are specified, the margins apply to the top, right, bottom, and left in that order (clockwise).</p>

    <h3>what is a Hook?</h3>
    <p>* Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. <br>
         Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.</p>
    <p>* Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy.</p>  
    <p>* Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related</p>   
    <p>* Hooks let you use more of React’s features without classes.</p>

    <h3>What Are Semantic HTML Tags?</h3>
    <p>* Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain. </p>
    <p>* For example, tags like header article  and footer, nav  semantic HTML tags. They clearly indicate the role of the content they contain.</p>
    <p>* On the other hand, tags like<div> and <span> are typical examples of non-semantic HTML elements.</p>

    <h3>What is difference between libery and framework.</h3>   
    <p>* Libery provide developers with predefine function and classes to make work easier and boost the development process. </p> 
    <p>* Framework, on the other hand, is like the foundation upon which developers build applications for specific platforms. </p>
    <p>* the main difference is the inversion of contorl.</p>
    <p>* By using liberys you can control the flow of application and call the libery. </p>
    <p>* In opposite, when you use the framework , framework contorl the flow of application, calls your code.</p>
    <p>Examples=> libery (JQuery, React JS, etc.),  framework	(Spring, NodeJS, AngularJS, Vue JS, etc.)</p>
